##Make Change Project

## Description
This Make Change Project will calculate the amount of change to return to the customer in each individual
unit of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c), utilizing the largest bill or coin denominations as possible.
When certain denominations are not in use, they will not display. The "shop" also has a limit of $100 in change and will
ask for a smaller bill. If you pay under the price of the goods, the "shop" will ask you again how much you'll be paying. 

## How To Use
You will first be prompted for an "item price", you are allowed to enter any number with a decimal to include a negative.
Press Enter,
You will then be prompted for the amount you are "paying", you are allowed to enter any number with a decimal to include a negative.
Press Enter,
Depending on what you inputed, a narrative will display or the loop may repeat. 

## What I Learned
This project allowed my to practice while, if and else statements. It also gave me practice with the Mod operator and 
how to utilize the remainder function it has. At a certain point in the process, I couldn't figure out how to return 
to the start of the loop to continue the scanner. I realized that this would require a while loop that ends in a 
continue instead of an if statement. With the Mod operator it took a lot of trial and error to translate "get the remainder
of this remainder" to achieve the individual currency amounts. I ended up doing a long chain of Mod, which may not be
the direct route but I will continue my research. 

## What I Can Improve
I can improve this code by learning how to create methods that can still initialize existing variables. This would make the 
code "cleaner" and easier to read. In addition, I would love to see if there is an easier way to express the Mod equations I
created for each currency unit.
