###Make Change Project

## Description
This Make Change Project will calculate the amount of change to return to the customer in each individual
unit of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c), utilizing the largest bill or coin denominations as possible.
When certain denominations are not in use, they will not display. The "shop" also has a limit of $100 in change and will
ask for a smaller bill. If you pay under the price of the goods, the "shop" will ask you again how much you'll be paying.
